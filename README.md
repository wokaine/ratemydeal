# Rate My Deal - a Python web application
Here you can find the information about this repo.
## Disclaimer
This project is not apart of my University course, it is simply a project that I wanted to do in an attempt to expand my portfolio a bit.

## About
This project is just a cool idea that I had. I wanted to design a web app where people could upload their Tesco Meal Deal that they may have had for lunch, as well as commenting or other people's deals. All done pseudoanonymously (i.e. fill in your name but no need for an account). 

## Progress
The first "phase" (for lack of a better word) is finished, this includes:
* Users can upload their deal to the website at the home page
* Deals are uploaded to a MongoDB database
* Users can view deals
* Users can leave a comment

Still having issues with deploying it onto Google Cloud.
