# Rate My Deal - a Python web application
Here you can find the information about this repo.
## Disclaimer
This project is not apart of my University course, it is simply a project that I wanted to do in an attempt to expand my portfolio a bit.

## About
Hopefully by the time you're reading this I will have put this on the Internet (or abandoned it completely). The premise of this application is for people to anonymously share a Tesco Meal Deal combination that they may have had. People are also able to comment, like and dislike the deals uploaded to the website.
